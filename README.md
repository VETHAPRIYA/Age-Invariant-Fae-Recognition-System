# Age-Invariant-Fae-Recognition-System
Developed an age-invariant face recognition system using a Siamese neural network trained with triplet loss to learn discriminative facial embeddings robust to age progression.  Utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone for feature extraction, applied data augmentation for improved generalization, and performed similarity-based face recognition.e ve
